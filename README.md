# TITAN PROTOCOL

Titan Protocol is a full-stack life gamification system that turns real-world habits, goals, and discipline into XP, dynamic levels, and fixed milestone-based ranks.

Built with:
- FastAPI (Backend API)
- Supabase PostgreSQL (Database)
- Next.js 16 + TypeScript (Frontend)
- Tailwind CSS (Neon / Cyber UI)

---

## 🚀 Vision

Titan Protocol transforms life into a structured progression engine:

- Earn XP for completing quests
- Level up dynamically
- Unlock fixed ranks at milestone levels
- Track habits, workouts, deep work sessions, and long-term goals
- Expand into gym logging, meditation tracking, and AI coaching

This is not a to-do app.

This is a life operating system.
